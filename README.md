# Diagram as code for conducting threat models

#### Diagram as code threat model Toolkit
The diagram as code threat model toolkit will: 

Allow you to create data flow diagrams based on plantUML as code (see [https://plantuml.com/](https://plantuml.com/) for more details) for threat modeling sessions. Since diagrams are automatically created the effort for ajusting the diagrams is reduced. To have a consistent approach to create diagrams the c4 Model Framework (see  [https://c4model.com/](https://c4model.com/ for more details) is used. There are ready to use include files available to integrate the c4 Model framework into plantUML (see [https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML) for more details). The plantUML files are then annotated with additional threat information which can be used for threat modeling sessions with stakeholders.
